Wreck-it-Ralph really liked to wreck things. He would demolish buildings, kick Lego sculptures and smash birthday cakes and this was all in a day's work. Ralph's particularly favorite thing to do however, was smashing cantaloupe. He enjoyed basking in the scent of the melons and feeling the soft, fleshy texture between his gargantuan fingers as he smashed the cantaloupe between his hands.

But Penelope loved to eat cantaloupe and would get awfully angry with Ralph when he wasted the precious cantaloupes. She'd get in her little car and rush over to try to stop him but he'd just hold it above her head, relishing in the feel of smashing the cantaloupe. Penelope could take it no longer.
