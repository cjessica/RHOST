Veggie Bacon,
oh veggie bacon
I weep for thee.
Why don't you taste like real bacon?
Why do you look like bacon
But are not bacon?
Forsooth, that thou hast forsaken me,
my veggie bacon.
For now my stomach revolts,
and roughage pervades.
The pigs' revenge is upon us.
Look for the conch,
it will protect from piggy,
and lead us to bacon.
